  "Passionate about object-oriented programming, I am very fond of languages such as C++, PHP and Python. During my last position, I was able to build and maintain ambitious e-commerce projects for the multinational corporation Pernod Ricard. Nowadays, I use this expertise as a freelancer, but I would like to find a job within a company once again. I am interested in Machine Learning as well, especially in computer vision. I like developing small projects in this domain during my spare time.": "Passionate about object-oriented programming, I am very fond of languages such as C++, PHP and Python.
